I want you to extend dotenvx and add support for YubiKey + GPG keys for encryption and decryption of environment variables. Create a detailed implementatio plan for yourself outlining the steps needed to implement this feature, including any necessary changes to the architecture, commands, and key entry points. Additionally, identify potential challenges and how to address them.
In case of doubts or several options ask me.
Write the plan in markdown format to a file.
ULTRATHINK!
